craigslist-multilocation-recent-jobs
Simple application that takes in search term & multiple locations and returns a file, sorted by most recent, the results with links

The default search term is "ruby" and the default locations are ["sfbay","sandiego", "orangecounty", "losangeles", "portland","seattle"]

This is my first application and wanted to put something out there I can use and others may be able to use or improve on

Multiple improvements that can be made off the top of my head:

Better use the time to provide more flexibility and user input
Better use of locations
Perhaps a webpage that is a bit more advaced with location checkboxes, radio button for time and search term
The get_data could be optimized to be more user friendly
The original idea was to provide a way to automatically apply (or probably more likely template the process)and there are steps that could help automate this.
